# datacom-kudos-system
A feature for Datacom’s internal employee portal that allows staff to send “kudos” messages to colleagues. Built using a spec-driven development workflow, this system supports message creation, a public kudos feed, and administrative moderation features such as hiding or deleting inappropriate content.
